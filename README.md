KivyLauncher

Simple program made in Python with Kivy.

It searches the patch for mini-games that I also wrote. Using the launcher, you can select a game, play it, uninstall it, view the source code and read the manual. 

I plan to add more mini-games in the future and adapt the program to be launched on mobile devices.
