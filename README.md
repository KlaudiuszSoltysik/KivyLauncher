KivyLauncher

Simple program made in Python with Kivy.

It searches the patch for mini-games that I also wrote. Using the launcher, you can select a game or app, play it, uninstall it, view the source code and read the manual.

Curently aviable apps (in "games" directory):

KivySudoku - made using backtracking algorithm, you can choose between three game difficulties. By pressing spacebar and then pressing cells, you can insert right numbers. You enter numbers by pressing a key on your keyboard and then pressing right cell on screen. To undo your numbers press backspace and press cell.

KivyTetris - my version of the game everyone knows, no other features. You can play with arrows (left, right, up to rotate, down for faster fall)

Gameplay:


KivyColor - an app you can use to pick colors that match with each other (based on "theory of colors"). You can lock the colors you like with spacebar and choose how much colors you want to pick with keyboard. Colors aren't randomized, I used a simple AI to catch the colors you don't like, so the algorithm can avoid them. You can reset the AI with backspace.
