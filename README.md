KivyLauncher

Simple program made in Python with Kivy.

It searches the patch for mini-games that I also wrote. Using the launcher, you can select a game, play it, uninstall it, view the source code and read the manual. 

Curently aviable/in progress games:

Sudoku (curently unplayable) - made using backtracking algorithm, you can choose between three game difficulties. By pressing space you can watch game playing by itself in real time. You enter numbers by pressing a key on your keyboard and then pressing right grid on screen.

Tetris - the game everyone knows, no other features
